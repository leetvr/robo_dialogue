# robo-dialogue
## What?
A tiny tool that takes a CSV file of dialogue, "records" it with text-to-speech and saves the result.

## Why?
Recording dialogue in games is hard and expensive. To iterate on dialogue quickly while integrating the results into the game, we wrote this little tool to let us get the dialogue just right before we pay people money to speak into a microphone.

## How?
Amazon Polly does all the work for us.
